    "What would happen if laws were erased and all crime became legal? One would assume that human beings would still have enough innate compassion to avoid killing each other, but many cases in history have demonstrated humanity's ability to act purely out of emotion and completely disregard social norms.  But is it the simple fact that certain actions are against the law that deter citizens from committing crimes, or is another layer of implication necessary to deter people from heinous actions? Modern research tends to agree with the latter idea, that the certainty and severity of punishment are critical to detering people from a life of crime.  Our research sets out to answer the question: \"To what extent does the probability of getting caught and the severity of the punishment reduce the crime rate in the North Carolina counties that have the highest percentage mix of face to face crimes?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of our analysis is going to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of two policies that are central to our campaign's crime reduction initiative:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Empowering police officers to build a network of citizens in their community who can help the officers find those responsible for committing crimes and increasing the probability that the perpetrators will be arrested.\n",
    "2. Harshening the punishments for repeat offenders by increasing the average sentences they receive in an effort to deter criminals from continuing to break the law."

    "## Model Building Process: Selecting Variables for all three models\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our research question, we selected crime rate (crmrte) as our dependent variable. For our analysis, we are assuming that face to face crimes are more likely to be violent crimes.  In order to generate results that would make a strong campaign message, we decided to have our analysis focus on the top half of counties that had a higher mix of face to face crimes. A sample size of 46 is not ideal, but it is large enough for us to move forward without any clear violations of CLM Assumptions based on sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we are doing a log - log comparison for the dependent variable and the independent variables. We feel that our analysis will provide stronger results by showing how a percentage change in one of the independent variables will cause a percentage change in crime rate.  The log - log comparison will allow us to compare across our variables without having to explain the units and range of each independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our base model needs to address the idea of crime and punishment, both the probability of getting caught and the punishment associated with getting caught.  For the probability of getting caught, we going to use probability of arrest (prbarr).  For the punishment associated with getting caught, we are going to use the probability of conviction (prbconv) and the average sentence (avgsen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these variables, we discovered that we needed to convert the probability of conviction to a numeric value (we are calling it prbconv2), which will allow us to perform further analysis on it.  In terms of outliers, we did find a clear outlier on the probability of arrest, which measures that likelihood that someone will be arrested after they have committed a crime. This metric should logically never exceed 100%, which is the circumstance where every crime committed is met with an arrest. We decided to omit the county that had above 100% probability of arrest in order to avoid contaminating our results. Looking at the other variables, we did not find anything that would bias our results.  For the variables in our base model, we see no evidence that would indicate a non-linear relationship with crime rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For model 2, we are keeping the same variables from the base model, and holding administrative characteristics constant. The administrative characteristics include police per capita (polpc) and tax revenue per capita (taxpc).  Keeping these two characteristics constant allows us to remove the potentially biasing factor of one counties justice system having more resources than another, which will enable us to focus specifically on how changing the probability of getting caught (probability of arrest) and the punishment associate with getting caught (probability of conviction and average sentence) will change the crime rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these variables for outliers, we found that tax revenue per capita had a mean of 38.06 and a max of 119.76. Considering that the next highest value was 75.76, we decided to not include the county that had the outlier value on Tax Revenue per capita and assume that the value was collected or reported in error.  Removing this county allows us to mitigate the potential bias from poor data collection or reporting standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the administrative variables, we see no evidence that would indicate a non-linear relationship with crime rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For model 3, we are examining the same punishment variables as the base model, holding the administrative characteristics from model 2 constant, and holding three demographic characteristics constant to help eliminate the potential bias that may arise from the group of people being different from one county to another.  Holding the percentage minority (pctmin80), percentage young male (pctymle), and population density (density) constant allows us to better examine the relationship between punishment and crime rate without having to worry about people from different demographics behaving in different ways.  Looking at these variables, we do not see any evidence of outliers or any evidence that a non-linear relationship with crime rate exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of our analysis, we are not including county, year, probability of prison sentence (prbpris), urban indicator (urban), west indicator (west), central indicator (central), and weekly wage across different industries (wcon, wtuc, wtrd, wfir, wser, wmfg, wfed, wsta, wloc).  Because we are not including any of these variables in our models, we are not examining them for outliers or for non-linear relationship with crime rate."

Furthermore, the $R^2 \\ = \\ .507$ seems to suggest that these variables account for a little more than 50% of the percent change in the crime rate. In terms of the social sciences, we can consider this value to be strong.  With the log - log transformation we can say that a 1% change in the unit rate of each of our independent variables will account for the $\\beta_i$ % change in the unit rate of the dependent variable.  For example, we can say that this model suggests that a 1% increase in the probablity of arrest is associated with a -0.98% change in the crime rate. \n",

This indicates that the we cannot reject a null hypthoses that $H_0: \\ \\beta_3 \\ = \\ 0$, meaning that avgsen is not stastically significant.

From a statistical signficance perspective, we can reject the null hypothesis that either 𝛽1(probability of arrest) or 𝛽8(percent minority) is 0, and that they are associated to changes in the crime rate. From a practical significance perspective, we can continue to argue that strengthening the severity of punishment can help with reducing crime rate, but any political policy that involves a stance on minority is always delicate and sensitive, and therefore does not provide actionable insight. In addition, we did anticipate that the covariates added for model 3(density, percent young male and percent minority) are variables that cannot be easily controlled or influenced from policies, and therefor may help the overall model from the perspective of removing any ommited variable impact in the key variables(punishment) we are interested in, but less so in forming a recommendation as a standalone variable.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular catch-phrase from the 1960's and 1970's \"Don't do the crime if you can't do the time\" certainly rings true even today. The key to lowering crime rate in North Carolina is to reinforce the connection between actions and consequences, especially in those areas that have a high rate of face to face crimes.  Our campaign is rooted in the mission of reducing the crime that matters. We are going to empower our police officers to form stronger bonds with the community and tap into their network to find those responsible for committing heinous, face to face crimes. Along with increasing the probability of arrest for those who commit crimes, we are also going to harshen the punishments for individuals that are repeat offenders.  We are confident that increasing the average sentence on criminals who continue to commit crimes after they have already been caught will help to deter them from choosing to break the law after they have already been caught once. Keeping North Carolina safe starts with empowering those who are charged with protecting us to find those responsible for crimes, and allowing them to implement a punishment structure that will deter citizens from breaking the law.\n"
